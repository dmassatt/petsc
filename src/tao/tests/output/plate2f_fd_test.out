Testing hand-coded gradient (hc) against finite difference gradient (fd), if the ratio ||fd - hc|| / ||hc|| is
0 (1.e-8), the hand-coded gradient is probably correct.
Run with -tao_fd_test_display to show difference
between hand-coded and finite difference gradient.
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 1, difference ||fd-hc|| = 0.187158
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 0.999999, difference ||fd-hc|| = 0.611553
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 1, difference ||fd-hc|| = 0.611553
Testing hand-coded Hessian (hc) against finite difference Hessian (fd). If the ratio is
O (1.e-8), the hand-coded Hessian is probably correct.
Run with -tao_fd_test_display to show difference
of hand-coded and finite difference Hessian.
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 3.01634e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 1.16017e-07
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 3.01634e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 1.16017e-07
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 3.01634e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 1.16017e-07
